# My NeoVim Config

This is a _heavily_ inspired (and for some files - directly copied) from [ChristianChiarulli's neovim](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/nvim). You can start-off with my config, and build something of your own from there, but ideally, you should always try writing your own. Using neovim, as [TJ DeVries](https://www.youtube.com/c/TJDeVries) says, usually becomes a PDE (Personal Development Environment). This config, just like any other config, is heavily personalized.

It's a current TODO for me to add instructions on how to set it up, but I'm not sure if it's needed. Please feel free to look at specific configs if you want to take inspiration, but I strongly suggest to start off with something from LunarVim/AstroVim/NvChad etc. and then build upon them to have something of your own. :) Sorry for being too honest, can't help it.
