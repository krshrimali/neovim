# LSP Migration Summary: COC.nvim → Native vim.lsp

## Overview

Successfully migrated from COC.nvim to Neovim's native LSP client with nvim-lspconfig. This provides better performance, especially for large Python workspaces, while maintaining all essential LSP functionality.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Plugin Configuration (`lua/user/plugins.lua`)
- **Removed**: `neoclide/coc.nvim` 
- **Added**: 
  - `neovim/nvim-lspconfig` - Core LSP configuration
  - `williamboman/mason.nvim` - LSP server management
  - `williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim` - Bridge between Mason and lspconfig

### 2. New LSP Configuration (`lua/user/lsp.lua`)
Created comprehensive native LSP setup with:

#### Language Server Support:
- **Python**: 
  - `pyright` for LSP features (hover, completion, go-to-definition)
  - `ruff` for fast linting and formatting (NOT pyright diagnostics)
  - Optimized for large workspaces with `diagnosticMode: "openFilesOnly"`
- **Rust**: `rust-analyzer` with Clippy integration
- **Lua**: `lua_ls` optimized for Neovim development
- **C/C++**: `clangd` with full feature support

#### Performance Optimizations:
- **Fast Completion**: Uses `vim.lsp.completion.enable()` with autotrigger
- **Efficient Diagnostics**: Virtual text disabled, update_in_insert disabled
- **Large Workspace Support**: Python analysis limited to open files only

#### Key Features:
- Auto-format on save for all supported languages
- Diagnostic signs with proper icons
- Hover diagnostics on cursor hold
- Complete keybinding setup (gd, gr, K, etc.)

### 3. Diagnostics Display (`lua/user/diagnostics_display.lua`)
- **Completely rewritten** to use native `vim.diagnostic` API
- Maintains familiar keybindings (`<leader>dl`, `<leader>df`, `<leader>dw`)
- Added workspace diagnostics view
- Better performance with native diagnostic handling

### 4. Keymaps Updated (`lua/user/keymaps.lua`)
- Uncommented LSP keymaps (F11, F12, Ctrl+S)
- Updated diagnostic keymaps to use new functions
- Removed COC-specific references

### 5. Removed Files
- `coc-settings.json` - No longer needed
- All COC-related configurations removed from `init.lua`

## Language Server Installation

### Installed LSP Servers:
```bash
# Python
pipx install pyright ruff

# Rust (with rustup)
rustup component add rust-analyzer

# C/C++
sudo apt install clangd

# Lua (handled by Mason automatically)
```

## Key Benefits

### Performance Improvements:
1. **Faster Startup**: No COC extension loading delays
2. **Responsive Completion**: Native `vim.lsp.completion` is faster than COC
3. **Large Workspace Friendly**: Python analysis limited to open files
4. **Memory Efficient**: Native LSP uses less memory than COC

### Better Integration:
1. **Native Diagnostics**: Seamless integration with Neovim's diagnostic system
2. **Consistent API**: All LSP features use standard vim.lsp functions
3. **Better Customization**: More granular control over LSP behavior

### Maintained Functionality:
- All essential LSP features (completion, diagnostics, navigation)
- Same keybindings for familiar workflow
- Diagnostic display windows with improved performance
- Auto-formatting on save

## Usage

### Essential Keybindings:
- `gd` - Go to definition
- `gr` - Go to references  
- `K` - Show hover information
- `<leader>rn` - Rename symbol
- `<leader>ca` - Code actions
- `<leader>f` - Format document
- `[g` / `]g` - Navigate diagnostics
- `<leader>dl` - Show line diagnostics
- `<leader>df` - Show file diagnostics
- `<leader>dw` - Show workspace diagnostics

### Completion:
- **Automatic**: Triggers as you type
- **Manual**: `<C-Space>` or `<C-x><C-o>`
- **Navigation**: `<Tab>` / `<S-Tab>` in completion menu
- **Accept**: `<CR>` to accept completion

## Testing

Created test files to verify functionality:
- `test_lsp.py` - Python with type errors for diagnostic testing
- `test_lsp.rs` - Rust with warnings for diagnostic testing

## Configuration Notes

### Python Optimization:
```lua
settings = {
    python = {
        analysis = {
            diagnosticMode = "openFilesOnly", -- Key for large workspaces
            typeCheckingMode = "basic",       -- Faster than "strict"
        },
    },
}
```

### Ruff Integration:
- Ruff handles formatting and diagnostics
- Pyright provides LSP features (hover, completion, navigation)
- Ruff's hover is disabled to avoid conflicts

### Mason Auto-Installation:
Mason will automatically install missing LSP servers on first use. The configuration ensures all required servers are available.

## Migration Complete ✅

The migration from COC.nvim to native vim.lsp is complete and fully functional. The setup provides better performance, especially for large Python codebases, while maintaining all essential development features.
